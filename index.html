                <li> This Website! <br /> This portfolio page is coded from scratch and uses only <a href="foundation.zurb.com/">Zurb Foundation</a> as a CSS framework. As you'll have already noticed, it's hosted using Github pages, which is indicative of my familiarity and knowledge of Github. Files for this website can all be found <a href="https://github.com/matthras/matthras.github.io">here</a>. </li>

              <h3>Other Web Dev. Work</h3>
              <ul>
                <li> My personal website: http://matthewmack.com.au <br /> The bulk of my web dev. work has been mostly done with Wordpress since my clients tend to be individual professionals or small businesses who simply needed a website to represent their business or personal brand, but also wanted to edit the content themselves. Through this work I built on my existing HTML knowledge and learnt basic CSS and PHP.</li>

              <h2>Math Apps</h2>
              <p>I'm interested in developing interactive maths applications that allow students to explore mathematical theories and ideas.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Sequences &amp; Series - Students often have trouble differentiating between sequences and series, as well as understanding the notion of limits and convergence.</li>

              <h2>Video Projects</h2>
              <h3>Let's Play YouTube Channel</h3>

              <p>One of my hobbies is maintaining a Let's Play Youtube channel, in which I only have one goal: post at least one video everyday, or at least seven videos a week. I've enjoyed teaching myself how to use recording and editing software such as Open Broadcaster Software and Adobe Premiere Pro. <br />
              Side benefits of this project include being a better impromptu speaker and learning about fair use, copyright law and the psychology of content producers and consumers.</p>
